## I Just Have A Question

> **Note:** Please do not file an issue to ask a question. You'll get faster 
results by following the guidelines below.

Feel free to ask you question directly on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/NShift/shift).
The collaborators and the community are all over the world and could reply at

## How To Contribute

### Before Contributing

You are welcome contribute to the GitHub Guidelines whenever you feel it can be 
improved or you can add to it.

Before you go on with your contribution, make sure to first do these steps:

1. Determine if the enhancement should be suggested in this repository.
2. Perform a search inside the [issues](/issues) and [pull requests](/pulls) 
sections to see if the issue has already been reported or not. If it has 
and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of 
opening a new one.

> :warning: If you create a new issue that addresses an enhancement that has 
already been suggested, your issue will be closed.

### Submiting An Issue

Any enhancement and bug report should be tracked as an issue created using 
[Github issue templates](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/). You should follow the 
proccess of [creating a new issue](/issues/new) by selecting one of the 
available options:

* [New app](/issues/new?template=new-apps.md): Suggest a new app that improve our 
productivity
* [Enhancement](/issues/new?template=enhancement.md): Suggest an enhancement on 
existing command lines
* [Bug Report](/issues/new?template=bug-report.md): Create a report to help us 
improve
* [Project Design](/issues/new?template=project-design.md): Suggest a better 
approach on project design

Issues should be fill out with the maximum of information and should follow the
instructions:

```markdown
## What's the issue?
<!-- Describe the context of the issue. -->
<!-- Describe the action that produces the issue. -->
<!-- Describe your expectation. -->

## Goals
<!-- List the high-level objectives of this issue. -->
<!-- Include any relevant context. -->

## Expectation
<!-- Describe your expectation. -->
```

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to `shift`? You can start by looking through 
the beginner issues with the following labels:

* [`Severity: Low`](/labels/Severity%3A%20Low): The issue concerns a new feature 
or any addition to the project
* [`Severity: Medium`](/labels/Severity%3A%20Medium): The issue reports cosmetic 
items, formatting, spelling, colors, etc.

### Pull Requests

* Fill in [the required template](/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
* Do not include issue numbers in the PR title
* Use `Closes` keyword, when it actually fixes the related issue
* Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible
* Give credit to those who inspired you
* Remove empty sections when using the pull request template
* Document new code based on the [Documentation Styleguide](#documentation)
* Add `changelog: [KEYWORD] DESCRIPTION` to the merging commit message to update the CHANGELOG
* Pull requests must be reviewed by at least 2 collaborators
* Continuous integration tool must validate the pull requests before merging

### Design Decisions

* Each significant decision in how we structure the project and what 
architecture we are using, should be documented it in the 
[ADR (Architecture Decision Record) folder](/ADR)
* ADR documents should follow the format described in the [ADR README file](/ADR/README.md)
* All decisions should be ensured by automated tests.

## Quality Assurance

`shift` is running using Travis.CI to ensure the quality of the product.

Currently, it will be overkilled to add unit tests for command lines. However, 
we should ensure the quality of the documentation, the project structure and
the collaboration (git commit, Github issues and pull requests, CHANGELOG) through
automated tests.

Every time the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is updated or a new ADR file is created, 
we should update the automated tests.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

Git commit messages should help reviewers to do better reviews. It is based on the
[Nigh Shift git commit message styleguide](https://github.com/nshift/github-guidelines#git-commit-messages).

You should configure your git hooks path, before writing a commit message:

```
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

The commit message hook tends to follow these rules:

* Write short messages (we recommend 80 characters or less)
* Add more details in [description commit section](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36427485)
* Use the present tense
* Use the imperative mood
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* Start your commit using emojis to describe the nature of the commit:
	* :computer: `:computer:` when writing new lines of code
	* :art: `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
	* :construction_worker: `:construction_worker:` when improving the format/structure of the project
	* :racehorse: `:racehorse:` when improving performance
	* :non-potable_water: `:non-potable_water:` when plugging memory leaks
	* :memo: `:memo:` when writing docs
	* :bug: `:bug:` when fixing a bug
	* :fire: `:fire:` when removing code or files
	* :green_heart: `:green_heart:` when fixing the CI build
	* :white_check_mark: `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests
	* :lock: `:lock:` when dealing with security
	* :arrow_up: `:arrow_up:` when upgrading dependencies
	* :arrow_down: `:arrow_down:` when downgrading dependencies
	* :shirt: `:shirt:` when removing linter warnings

### Documentation

* Use `##` to document the code
* A comment should be wrapped if it exceed 80 columns
* Group and document all the command line related to a specific subject
* Group should contain few command lines
* Provide enough information related to the group:
	* Title
	* Short description
	* Related resources.
* Make sure a report can be generated:
	* Use `step` function before executing group command lines
	* Use `success` function when command lines have been successfuly executed
	* Use `error` function when command lines failed.

**Example:**
```markdown

* The release date of each versions is displayed
* Add pull request number at the end of each entry
* Add Github author at the end of each entry, only if the contributor is not a 
collaborator
* The same types of changes should be grouped
* Use keywords to use for a complete changelog:
	* `Added` for new features
	* `Changed` for changes in existing functionality
	* `Deprecated` for soon-to-be removed features
	* `Removed` for now removed features
	* `Fixed` for any bug fixes
