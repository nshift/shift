# Architecture Decision Record

An architectural decision (AD) is a software design choice that addresses a 
significant requirement. An architecturally significant requirement (ASR) is a 
requirement that has a measurable effect on a software systemâ€™s architecture.

The goal is to keep track of the decisions and help the new contributors to 
quickly be up to date regarding the latest decisions.

## File Name Convention

We prefer to use a file name convention that has a specific format:

* The name has the date as `YYYY-MM-DD`. This is ISO standard and helps for sorting
by date.
* The name has a present tense imperative verb phrase. This helps readability 
and matches our commit message format.
* The name uses sentence capitalization and spaces. This is helpful for readability.
* The extension is markdown. This can be useful for easy formatting.

**Preferred:**
```
2018-01-01 Choose a database.md
2018-01-02 Handle more users.md
2018-01-03 Improve application security.md
```

**Not Preferred:**
```
New database structure.md
2018-01-02 How we handle more users.md
2018-01-03 Improve application security.txt
```

## Structure Of The Document

The structure of the document should be very simple:

* **Title**: short present tense imperative phrase, less than 50 characters, 
like a git commit message.
* **Context**: what is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this 
decision or change.
* **Decision**: what is the change that we're actually proposing or doing.
* **Consequences**: what becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this 
change.

The Decision section is the most important section of the document. It will 
describe **why**, **how** and **what** the dicision is about. It should contain
examples and sample code.

**Example**:

# Choose An Architecture

This document intend to record an architectural decision that addresses a 
significant requirement. It has been written by Romain ASNAR in 24th April of 
2018.

## Context

MyTune requires to use MVVM pattern. Our goal is to implement an architecture 
that is maintainable, testable, scalable and evolvable.

It will help us to avoid Massive View Controllers and be able to ship frequently 
with a high standard code quality.

Architecture should solve a particular design problem and be clear by its 
organisation.

## Decision

We will use MVVM pattern, follow SOLID principles and organize our code by 
isolating features.

### SOLID

Following SOLID principles will help the team to build classes that are more 
reusable, maintainable and testable.

The two principles that must be followed at any cost should be:

- *Single Responsibility*: classes should have only one single responsibility
- *Dependency Inversion*:  classes should

Prefered:

\```swift
class MyTuneAPI {
    var network: MyTuneAPINetworkInterface
    
    init(network: MyTuneAPINetworkInterface) {
        self.network = network
    }
    
    func findUserPlaylist(userID: String) -> ((Result<MyTunePlaylist>) -> Void) {
        return {
            self.network.getUserPlaylist(userID: String) { result in
                ...
            }
        }
    }
}
\```

Not Prefered:

\```swift
class MyTuneAPI {
    func findUserPlaylist(userID: String) -> ((Result<MyTunePlaylist>) -> Void) {
        Alamofire.request().responseString {
            ...
        }
    }
}
\```

It will help the team to have the same approach when creating classes and 
standardize the code.

### Scalability

Architecture is not just about how to implement a particular design pattern, 
it is also about how code is organized in the project folder.

In order to reach scalability, features should be independent from each others. 
Adding more features should not impact other features. Each feature should be 
stored into a related domain folder. This pattern is described as micro features.

Prefered:

\```
MyTune
    -- User
        -- Authenticate
            -- User Interface
            -- Business Logic
    -- Playlist
        -- List
            -- User Interface
            -- Business Logic
        -- Read
            -- User Interface
            -- Business Logic
    -- Tracks
        -- List
            -- User Interface
            -- Business Logic
\```

Not Prefered:

\```
MyTune
    -- ViewControllers
        -- UserAuthenticationViewControllers.swift
        -- UserPlaylistViewControllers.swift
        -- PlaylistInformationViewControllers.swift
        -- PlaylistTracksViewControllers.swift
    -- ViewModels
        -- UserAuthenticationViewModels.swift
        -- UserPlaylistViewModels.swift
        -- PlaylistInformationViewModels.swift
        -- PlaylistTracksViewModels.swift
\```

It will help developers to quickly identify a specific feature and  define 
feature boundaries.

## Consequences

* A better collaboration between the contriubutors
* Easier to maintain
* An organization by features
* Being able to scale by adding more features without pain
